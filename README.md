# RIANA - Relative Isotope Abundance Analyzer

RIANA (Relative Isotope Abundance Analyzer) takes in standard mass spectrometry spectra and spectral ID files,
and returns mass isotopomer distributions, e.g., for protein turnover analysis.


## Getting Started

Installation:

Install Python 3.7+ and pip. See instructions on Python website for specific instructions for your operating system.

Riana can be installed from PyPI via pip. We recommend using a virtual environment.

    $ pip install riana

Launch riana as a module (Usage/Help):
	
	$ python -m riana

Alternatively as a console entry point:

    $ riana
    
To test that the installation can load test data files in tests/data:

    $ pip install tox
    $ tox

To run the riana test dataset (a single fraction bovine serum albumin file from a Q-Exactive) and print the result
to the home directory:

    $ python -m riana tests/data/ -u -i 0,1,2,3,4,5 -q 0.1 -r 0.5 -t 10 -o ~/
    
Notes on the expected input files:

	* RIANA.py was tested on the percolator output file from Crux Tide/Percolator or standalone Comet/Percolator.

	* The following workflow has been tested for both amino acid and heavy water labeling data gathered on a QE:

	* Convert raw files to mzML, using pwiz 3.0 msconvert in command line, with the following option:
		** --filter "peakPicking vendor"

	* Download Crux 3.1

	* Run Tide index with the following options:
	    ** --digestion partial-digest
	    ** --missed-cleavages

	* Run Tide search with the following options:
		** --isotope-error 1,2 (for HW) or 6,12 (for AA)
		** --compute-sp T
		** --mz-bin-width 0.02
		** --mz-bin-offset 0.0
		** --precursor-window 20
		** --precursor-window-type ppm

	* Run Percolator with the following options:
		** --protein T
		** --fido-empirical-protein-q T

    * Input to RIANA.py:

    ** Note that the riana argument path should point to the project directory, where each individual sample mzML and
     search result files are placed under a sub-directory (e.g., sample1/mzml, sample1/percolator, sample2/mzml, sample2/percolator, etc.)
	

### Dependencies

RIANA.py is tested in Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and uses the following packages:

```
matplotlib==3.4.1
pandas==1.2.4
pymzml==2.4.7
tqdm==4.60.0
scikit-learn==0.24.2
```
