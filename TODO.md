- add args for users to specify iso/neutron mass
- add function to calculate peptide accurate mass from scratch and check against percolator
- add support for noncanonical aa
- validate label free/ibaq against ionquant or maxquant

Mid term:
- smoothing function
- write tests for match between run functions
