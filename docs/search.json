For the most cases this shouldn’t present a problem if the mzml directory contains exactly the same mzml files used for the database search, unless there is a difference in how the operating system order files on the search computer (e.g., file_10.mzml vs. file_2. mzml) or if one of the fractions contained no protein ID and Crux/Percolator decided to skip the file in its indexing.\nTo support multi-fraction analysis, RIANA now takes in Percolator tab delimited files for protein ID rather than mzid. Mzid support will be added back in in a future version."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A: The -D flag specifies the accurate mass difference between each unit isotopomer and can be set to D, C13, or SILAC, which will dictate the mass difference across each successive peak to be 1.0063 (mass difference of deuterium and protium), 1.003 (mass difference of 13C and 12C), and 1.001 (custom SILAC mass), respectively. This is set so that RIANA can find the correct accurate mass for integration when multiple atom centers are added. E.g., if deuterium labeled amino acids are used, e.g., D3-leucine, the argument should be set to -D D and the integrated isotopomer argument set to -i 0, 3. Alternatively if 13C6-lysines, the arguments should be -D C13 and i 0,6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: The simple, guan, and fornasiero options for the model argument refer to a simple exponential (one-pool) model, a two-compartment model, and a two-compartment model that includes label reutilization. See the Documentation page for details.\n\n\n\nA: The --label argument determines how the fraction of new proteins at a particular labeling time point is calculated from the relative abundance of isotopomers. The option aa assumes that the first peaks of light or heavy amino acids are used for calculations (e.g., m0, m6 for 13C6-lysine) and hence the initial pre-label fraction of the light peak (m0) is assumed to be 1. The option hw assumes a heavy water type labeling experiment where the entire isotopomer cluster of the peptide is integrated (e.g., m0, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5), and hence the pre-labeling fraction of the m0 peak is calculated from peptide relative isotopomer abundance based on naturally occurring isotopes.\nTo perform cell culture analysis: Use -l hw_cell to use the labeling sites calibrated for human AC6 cells (see Alamillo et al. bioRxiv 2025 for details). To alter the heavy water per-residue labeling sites for other cell types or organisms, modify the params.py file directly and run from the modified copy of RIANA.\n\n\n\nA: The directories are intended to facilitate navigation only rather than a rigorous indication of data quality. Plots for fitted curves with k < 0.01 are in the “slow” directory, 0.01 <= k <= 1 in the “mid” directory, and 1 < k in the “fast” directory. Plots for fitted curves with R2 >= 0.5 are in the “fit” directory, and those with R2 < 0.5 are in the “poor” directory.\n\n\n\nA: RIANA currently performs curve fitting at the peptide level only. Users can perform protein-level curve fitting using the {sample}_riana.txt integration result files. Alternatively, protein-level rate constants can be derived by taking a median or harmonic mean of the peptide-level rate constants with similar results, as we showed in our recent publication.\n\n\n\nA: The half-life of a peptide or protein can be calculated from the output k parameter using the equation:\n\\[ t_{1/2} = ln(2)/k \\]\n\n\n\nA: This can be modified under -f --fs. The default option is m0/mA m0_mA and can be changed to m0_m1 or Auto - please see Currie et al. J Proteome Res 2025 for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Contact us at [edward.lau@cuanschutz.edu]"

    "text": "RIANA has two components, integrate and fit (experimental), which can be individually called using riana integrate and riana fit. For the help message of each component, type riana integrate -h and riana fit -h.\n\n\nThe integrate component reads in mass spectrometry data files (.mzML) and the corresponding Percolator search result. The Percolator results cna be supplied directly to RIANA or generated automatically from the mass spectrometry data files using the included Snakemake ppeline).\nRIANA reads and filters the search result files based on the -q argument for Percolator adjusted P values and the -u flag for protein-unique peptides. For each qualifying peptide-charge concatamer, RIANA then calculates the accurate mass and m/z of the unlabeled (m0) isotopomer, as well as each of the successive isotopomers specified in the -i argument.\nRIANA then reads the corresponding mass spectrometry file and locate the scans from which the peptide was identified, plus a retention time (rt) window -r and retrieve the intensity over rt of each isotopomer. The areas-under-curve of each extracted ion chromatogram is then integrated usign the trapezoid method and written into the output file.\nThe intensity over rt data prior to integration can also be saved directly using the -w flag. This will create a large file (up to 10s of Gbs) for each experimental time point.\n\n\n\nRetrieved chromatograms of isotopomers m0-m6 for a peptide. Note the gradual decrease of the relative intensity of the m0 peak (lightest in color) as labeling proceeds (from left to right)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fit component takes in the integration results from multiple mass spectrometry experiments, and fits the relative isotope abundance data across labeling time points to a specified kinetic model.\nThree models ar ecurrently supported. In the simple model, the fraction of new protein over labeling time behavior of a peptide is described by an exponential decay equation with one parameter (\\(k\\)):\n\\[ A_t = A_{t=0} + (A_{t\\rightarrow \\infty} - A_{t=0}) \\cdot 1 - e^{-k t} \\]\nwhere \\(A_{t=0}\\) is the initial relative abundance of the m0 peak over the mi peaks, and is set to 1 in amino acid labeling experiments. \\(A_{t\\rightarrow \\infty}\\) is calculated based on the plateau relative isotope abundance, which is based on the number of labeling sites in a peptide and the precursor plateau enrichment. The latter is supplied through the -r argument in riana fit.\nGuan et al. 2012 PMID: 22444387\nThe two-compartment model is implemented as in Guan et al. 2012. The fraction of new protein over labeling time behavior of a peptide is described by a two-exponent model with the protein turnover rate constant (\\(k\\)) as well as the precursor availability rate constant (\\(k_p\\)):\n\\[ A_t = A_{t=0} + (A_{t\\rightarrow \\infty} - A_{t=0}) \\cdot \\frac{1 - ( e^{-kt}k_p - e^{-k_pt}k)}{k_p - k } \\]\nFornasiero et al. 2018 PMID: 30315172\nThe Fornasiero model two-compartment, three-exponent model additionally attempts to account for the effect of precursor reutilization from proteome-wide protein degradation. The two additional parameters --kr and --rp must be provided to denote the reutilization rate constant and the proportion of protein-bound vs. free precursors. Details are described in the original publication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent fitting limitations\n\n\n\nCurrently RIANA only calculates fractional synthesis of new peptides based on the decrease of the unlabeled (m0) over all specified isotopomers (m0 - mi). Future updates will allows specification of numerators and denominators in calculating fractional synthesis for more flexible experimental designs."
