## About RIANA

RIANA (**R**elative **I**sotope **A**bundance A**na**lyzer) is a software to automate the analysis of mass spectrometry-
based protein turnover measurement experiments.

RIANA is written to be flexible to accommodate different protein stable isotope labels, including heavy water (D~2~O) and
SILAC (e.g., ^13^C~6~-lysine or other amino acids) experiments.

RIANA supports a Snakemake pipeline that uses other existing tools in the community, requiring only mass spectrometry
data files (.mzML) as input to perform database search, post-processing, peak integration, and output of best-fit
kinetic rate constants.
