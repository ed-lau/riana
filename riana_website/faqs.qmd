## FAQs

### Integrate

#### Q: What does the `-D --mass_defect` argument do for the integrate function?

A: The `-D` flag specifies the accurate mass difference between each unit isotopomer and can be set to `D`, `C13`, or
`SILAC`, which will dictate the mass difference across each successive peak to be 1.0063 (mass difference of
deuterium and protium), 1.003 (mass difference of ^13^C and ^12^C), and 1.001 (custom SILAC mass), respectively. This is
set so that RIANA can find the correct accurate mass for integration when multiple atom centers are added. E.g., if
deuterium labeled amino acids are used, e.g., D^3^-leucine, the argument should be set to `-D D` and the integrated
isotopomer argument set to `-i 0, 3`. Alternatively if ^13^C~6~-lysines, the arguments should be `-D C13` and `i 0,6`.

### Fit

#### Q: What are the kinetic models being specified by the different fit options?

A: The `simple`, `guan`, and `fornasiero` options for the model argument refer to a simple exponential (one-pool) model,
a two-compartment model, and a two-compartment model that includes label reutilization.
See the [Documentation](about.qmd) page for details.

#### Q: What does the `-l --label` argument do?

A: The `--label` argument determines how the fraction of new proteins at a particular labeling time point is calculated
from the relative abundance of isotopomers. The option `aa` assumes that the first peaks of light or heavy amino acids
are used for calculations (e.g., m0, m6 for ^13^C~6~-lysine) and hence the initial pre-label fraction of the light peak
(m0) is assumed to be 1. The option `hw` assumes a heavy water type labeling experiment where the entire isotopomer
cluster of the peptide is integrated (e.g., m0, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5), and hence the pre-labeling fraction of the m0 peak
is calculated from peptide relative isotopomer abundance based on naturally occurring isotopes.

**To perform cell culture analysis:** Use `-l hw_cell` to use the labeling sites calibrated for human AC6 cells (see Alamillo et al. bioRxiv 2025 for details). To alter the heavy water per-residue labeling sites for other cell types or organisms, modify the `params.py` file directly and run from the modified copy of RIANA.

#### Q: How are the plotted curves separated to the curves_fast_fit, curves_mid_fit, and curve_slow_fit directories?

A: The directories are intended to facilitate navigation only rather than a rigorous indication of data quality.
Plots for fitted curves with k < 0.01 are in the "slow" directory, 0.01 <= k <= 1 in the "mid" directory, and
1 < k in the "fast" directory. Plots for fitted curves with R^2^ >= 0.5 are in the "fit" directory, and those with
R^2^ < 0.5 are in the "poor" directory.

#### Q: Does RIANA fit perform protein level curve fitting?

A: RIANA currently performs curve fitting at the peptide level only. Users can perform protein-level curve fitting
using the `{sample}_riana.txt` integration result files. Alternatively, protein-level rate constants can be derived
by taking a median or harmonic mean of the peptide-level rate constants with similar results, as we showed in our recent 
[publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcpro.2022.100252).

#### Q: How do I retrieve half-life information on the peptide and protein?

A: The half-life of a peptide or protein can be calculated from the output `k` parameter using the equation:

$$ t_{1/2} = ln(2)/k $$


#### Q: How do I use limited mass isotopomers or rule-based mass isotopomer selection for fractional synthesis rate calculation?

A: This can be  modified under `-f --fs`. The default option is m0/mA `m0_mA` and can be changed to `m0_m1` or `Auto` - please see Currie et al. J Proteome Res 2025 for details.
